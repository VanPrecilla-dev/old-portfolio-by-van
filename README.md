**Old-Portfolio-By-Van with To-Do-List, Login & Create Account built using vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP & MySql (Xampp)**

**Project Overview:**

- This is the first portfolio I created when I started my web development career back in December 2022, showcasing a To-Do List feature.
- The design might seem a bit tacky since I used only vanilla CSS for this project.
- The portfolio includes sections for my profile, portfolio, and contact information.
- Also added some of my codes for tictactoe build using c++, photography and graphic design.
- However, I didn't deploy it at that time because I utilized PHP and MySQL.
- When I attempted to deploy it, I was hired as an Associate Software Engineer and received training in other programming languages.
- Please watch the video as a demo for this project.
